  INSTALLATION GUIDE
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Preface
-------
Giada depends on FLTK (http://www.fltk.org), RtAudio
(http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/) and libsndfile
(http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/). Please install these libraries
before compiling from source.



Building Giada from source
--------------------------
The configure script is designed for Unix systems and MinGW (Windows). 
It will help you to guess correct values for various system-dependent 
variables used during compilation. You need to pass it the "--target" 
parameter depending on your operating system:

	./configure --target=[linux | osx | windows]

e.g. if you want to compile for Linux, do:

	./configure --target=linux
	
When the script is done without errors, change directory to "src"
	
	cd src

then type 
	
	make 

to compile everything. If you wish to install Giada become root and 
type 

	make install 
	
to copy the binary file into /usr/local/bin path.
